This code defines a parser for a C-like programming language. The parser reads the input source code and produces a parse tree based on the grammar rules defined in the `productions` tuple. The parse tree is then used by the semantic analyzer to perform type checking and generate intermediate code.


The non_terminal_to_missing_construct dictionary maps non-terminal symbols to their corresponding missing constructs. This dictionary is used to generate error messages when a syntax error is encountered during parsing.
For example, if the parser expects to see a variable declaration but encounters a semicolon instead, it will generate an error message indicating that a variable declaration is missing. The missing construct for the Declaration non-terminal is "int ID;", which indicates that a variable declaration consists of the int keyword followed by an identifier and a semicolon.
The non_terminal_to_missing_construct dictionary is used to generate these error messages by looking up the missing construct for the non-terminal symbol that caused the syntax error. The missing construct is then included in the error message to help the user understand what is missing from the input source code.
The `productions` tuple defines the grammar rules for the programming language. Each production rule is represented as a tuple of symbols, where the first symbol is the non-terminal and the remaining symbols are the right-hand side of the production rule.

The `terminal_to_col` dictionary maps terminals to their corresponding column numbers in the parsing table.

The `non_terminal_to_row` dictionary maps non-terminals to their corresponding row numbers in the parsing table.

The `parsing_table` tuple defines the parsing table for the programming language. Each row of the table corresponds to a non-terminal, and each column corresponds to a terminal. The entries in the table are the production rule indices that should be applied when the non-terminal is at the top of the parse stack and the terminal is the next input symbol.

The `Parser` class is defined at the bottom of the code. It has several methods that are used to parse the input source code and build the parse tree.

The `__init__` method initializes the parser by creating a new `Lexer` object and a new `SemanticAnalyser` object. It also creates a root node for the parse tree and initializes the parse stack with the root node and a special `$` node.

The `syntax_errors` property returns a string that contains a list of all syntax errors that were encountered during parsing.

The `save_parse_tree` method saves the parse tree to a file.

The `save_syntax_errors` method saves the syntax errors to a file.

The `_remove_node` method removes a node from the parse tree.

The `_clean_up_tree` method removes non-terminals and unmet terminals from leaf nodes in the parse tree.

The `parse` method is the main workhorse of the parser. It reads the input source code and tokenizes it using the `Lexer` object. It then uses the `SemanticAnalyser` object to perform semantic checking and generate intermediate code. It also builds the parse tree by recursively applying the production rules defined in the `productions` tuple.
